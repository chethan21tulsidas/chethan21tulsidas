Projects
Racing for Sustainability – Mitigating the Adverse Impact of the Formula 1 Race Schedule

    Description: My MSc Dissertation focusing on reducing the global carbon footprint of Formula 1 races by optimizing the race schedule.

    Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Google OR-Tools, Jupyter, SPSS, Tableau

    Outcome: Reduced total travel distance by 47% and the estimated carbon footprint by 45% while staying within viable operational constraints.

Striker Market Valuation in Football: A Regression Analysis using FIFA 22 Data

    Description: A report that demonstrates how freely-available video game data can be used for estimating the market value of football players.

    Technologies: Python, Pandas, Jupyter, SPSS, Tableau

    Outcome: Explained 92.1% of the variation in player market value of strikers using FIFA 22 data.

Kaizen – A Statistical Football Betting Assistant Tool
